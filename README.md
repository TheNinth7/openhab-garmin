## Introduction

This app is built using the Garmin Connect IQ SDK and is based on [openHAB sitemaps](https://www.openhab.org/docs/ui/sitemaps.html).

It includes two application types:

- _**Glance**_: A lightweight, quick-access entry point.
- _**Widget**_: The main, full-screen interface for interacting with the sitemap.

### _Widget_ Overview

The _Widget_:

- Displays a hierarchical structure representing a single sitemap, using the SDK's `CustomMenu` and `CustomMenuItem`.
- Requests sitemap updates at a configurable interval.
- Updates the menu whenever a new response is received.
- Caches the latest sitemap response in persistent storage.
- Renders sitemap *Widget*s using specific `CustomMenuItem` implementations, which may also send commands to items.

### _Glance_ Overview

The _Glance_:

- Displays the sitemap label.
- If sufficient memory is available, it also requests the sitemap at the same interval as the _Widget_ and caches it in storage, allowing the _Widget_ to start with a fresh state.

# Project Structure

The project is organised into the following directories:

## Root Folder `/`

The root directory contains essential project files.

**Key files:**

- `README.md`: This file
- `manifest.xml`: Defines the app's structure, supported devices, and required permissions (e.g., storage, background tasks)
- `monkey.jungle`: The build script that determines available features per device. It includes extensive documentation in the file itself.

**Further reading:**

- [Connect IQ SDK Core Topics - Manifest and Permissions](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/core-topics/manifest-and-permissions/)  
- [Connect IQ SDK Core Topics - Build Configuration](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/core-topics/build-configuration/)

<br>

## Folder `/.vscode`

Contains VS Code customizations.

## Folder `/docs`

Contains the user manual, published at <https://next.openhab.org/docs/apps/garmin/>.

<br>

## Folder `/releases`

This folder contains compiled binary releases of the app, intended for upload to the Garmin Connect IQ Store.

<br>

## Folder `/resources`

In the Connect IQ SDK, resources define:

- **Properties**: Parameters stored outside the app and not visible to the user. These are currently _not_ used by the app; instead, more flexible **Constants** are used. See [Folder `source-constants`](#folder-source-constants) for details.

- **Settings**: User-facing configurations
- **Drawables**: Image assets used by the app
- **Strings**: Text values like app name and version

**Folder breakdown:**

- `/resources/base`: Contains resources shared across all device types.
  - `/resources/base/drawables.xml`: Defines image assets used in the app (referenced as `Drawable` elements).
  - `/resources/base/settings.xml`: Specifies the appâ€™s configuration settings, including default values, types, and user-facing descriptions.
  - `/resources/base/string.xml`: Contains static string values such as the app name and version number.
- `/resources/edge`: Contains resources specific to Garmin Edge devices. Some `Drawable` elements are overridden here to account for different sizing requirements.
- `/resources/launcher-icons`: Contains one subdirectory per launcher icon size. Each subdirectory includes a resource definition for that specific size. The correct icon is selected via the resource path in the `monkey.jungle` build file, depending on the target device.
- `/resources/svg`: Contains the original SVG files used to generate `Drawable` resources.

<br>

## Folder `/source`

The app is written in **Monkey C**, Garmin's programming language, using the Connect IQ SDK API for UI, settings, persistent storage, and HTTP requests to openHAB.

For more details, continue reading the folderâ€™s [README](https://github.com/TheNinth7/ohg/tree/main/source#folder-source).

<br>

## Folder `/source-constants`

This folder defines device-specific configuration using code-based _Constants_, which replace Garmin SDK _Properties_ due to their limitations. Unlike _Properties_, _Constants_ are embedded in the code, update automatically with new app versions, and benefit from compiler validation.

For more details, continue reading the folderâ€™s [README](https://github.com/TheNinth7/ohg/tree/main/source-constants#folder-source-constants).

# Build Instructions

Follow the steps below to build, run, and test the app using the Connect IQ SDK and Garmin simulator.
<br>

## To Run the App in the Garmin Simulator

1. Install:
   - Visual Studio Code
   - Git
   - [Connect IQ SDK](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/sdk/) (see [Connect IQ SDK Installation](docs/SDK_INSTALLATION.md) for troubleshooting)
   - Monkey C extension for VS Code

1. Open VS Code and clone the `openhab-garmin` repository
1. Open any file in the `/source` folder
1. Press **F5** to start the simulator and select a target device
1. Go to `File` â†’ `Edit Persistent Storage` â†’ `Edit Application.Properties` and configure as needed  
   - To allow HTTP URLs, uncheck `Settings > Use Device HTTPS Requirements`

<br>

## To Compile for a Single Device

1. Press `CTRL+SHIFT+P` â†’ `Monkey C: Build Current Project`

<br>

## Generating the `.iq` File for Garmin Connect IQ Store Upload

Follow these steps to prepare and export your app for upload to the Garmin Connect IQ Store:

1. **Remove Debug Statements**

   Ensure all debug logging or print statements are commented out or removed.
   See [Removing Debug Statements](#removing-debug-statements) for guidance.

1. **Update the Version Number**

   Edit the file `resources/base/strings.xml` and set the correct version number for this release.

1. **Set the Correct App ID**

   Open `manifest.xml` and set the appropriate app ID:

   - Use the _stable_ app ID for production releases.
   - Use the _beta_ app ID for test releases.

   > ðŸ›  Youâ€™ll need to switch to XML mode in your editor to change this value manually.

1. **Export the Project**

   Use the command palette:
   `CTRL + SHIFT + P` â†’ `Monkey C: Export Project`
   This will generate the `.iq` file used for uploading.

<br>

## To Add a New Device

To support a new device:

1. If the device isn't available in your current SDK, launch the **SDK Manager** and download/activate the latest version.
1. In `manifest.xml`, check the new device in the supported device list.
1. Configure device-specific features in the `monkey.jungle` build file (see [Root Folder `/`](#root-folder-)).
1. Test in the simulator (see [above](#to-run-the-app-in-the-garmin-simulator))
1. Export the project (`CTRL+SHIFT+P` â†’ `Monkey C: Export Project`) and upload the `.iq` file to the Connect IQ Store

# Helpful Tips and Notes

A collection of useful information for working on this project.

## Removing Debug Statements

While debug statements are only printed in debug builds, they still occupy code space in release builds. Therefore, when building a release, all debug statements should be commented out.

To find all active debug statements in VS Code, press `CTRL+SHIFT+H` to open the global search and replace panel. Enable regular expressions by clicking the `.*` icon next to the search field, and use the following pattern to locate all active debug statements:

```regexp
(?<!\/\/ )Logger\.debug\(
```

To deactivate the debug statements, replace them with:

```text
// Logger.debug(
```

This will comment them out without affecting any lines that are already commented.
