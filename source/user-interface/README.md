# Folder `user-interface`

This directory contains the implementation of the user interface.

The main UI is built on top of a `CustomMenu`, a customizable variant of `Menu2`, leveraging the native UI controls of the watch. Sitemap widgets are implemented as `CustomMenuItem` instances. These display a state and may offer direct control (e.g., toggle switches) or open full-screen views for more complex interactions with sitemap elements.

The *Settings* menu is also implemented using a `CustomMenu`.

## Folder `commons`

Contains classes used across all UI components.

### `drawables/`

Contains classes that represent and enhance drawable objects from the Garmin SDK. These classes extend the SDK's functionality, especially for improved positioning and compatibility with older SDK versions.

* `BufferedBitmapDrawable`, `BufferedBitmapFactory`, and `LegacyBufferedBitmap`:
  Provide workarounds for limitations in the Garmin SDK prior to CIQ 4.0.0, where `BufferedBitmap` lacked the functionality needed for custom positioning logic.

* `CustomBitmap` and `CustomText`:
  Extend the SDK’s `Bitmap` and `Text` classes to support proportional positioning relative to screen dimensions. While the SDK supports only basic centering, these enhancements allow placement based on percentages—e.g., positioning an element at 30% of the screen height.

### `menu-base/`

Contains base classes for menu implementations:

* `BaseMenu`: Extends `CustomMenu` and applies consistent styling across all menus in the app.
* `BaseMenuItem`: Extends `CustomMenuItem` to provide consistent behavior and styling support across the app. At present, its main function is to enable the focus indicator used on Garmin Edge devices.

Note that apart from that, the *Settings* menu and sitemap menus currently use differently styled menu items. Common styling for sitemap-related menu items is implemented in `sitemap-menu/base/BaseSitemapMenuItem`.

### `misc/`

Contains basic utility classes used throughout the UI components:

* `CustomMath`: Provides common math helper functions.
* `TextDimensions`: Allows calculating the width of text without requiring a `Dc` (drawing context), useful in contexts where rendering is not yet possible.

---

## Folder `control-views`

Contains classes that implement full-screen views for controlling openHAB items.

### `commons/`

Shared components used across different control views:

* **`custom-view/`**
  Defines the base class for control views (`CustomView`) and the input delegate.

* **`input-hints/`**
  Contains classes for rendering input hints—visual indicators that map physical button actions on the device.

* **`picker/`**
  Implements a custom replacement for the Garmin SDK's `Picker`, allowing users to scroll through and select from a list of text values.
  See the `CustomPicker` class for details on why a custom implementation was chosen.

* **`touch-area/`**
  Enables the definition of circular and rectangular screen areas that trigger actions. These classes integrate with `CustomView` to support touch interaction.

### `slider/`

Implements the Slider widget, built on top of the `CustomPicker`, to allow selection from a range of numeric values.

---

## Folder `error-handling`

Handles and displays exceptions within the app.

* `ErrorView`: A full-screen view that displays exceptions. Includes static methods to show or hide the view.
* `ExceptionHandler`: Provides reusable methods for managing exceptions throughout the app. Its primary role is to determine whether an error should be shown as a toast notification (for non-fatal errors) or via a full-screen error view (for fatal errors). It also implements logic to escalate non-fatal errors to fatal ones if they persist beyond a defined duration.
* `ToastHandler`: Determines if non-fatal errors should be shown as toast notifications and offers a method for displaying them.

## Folder `glance-view`

Implements the *Glance* view.

## Folder `loading-view`

Displays a full-screen "Loading..." message. This view appears when the widget starts and no sitemap is available in storage, and remains visible until a sitemap is received from the server.

---

## Folder `settings-menu`

Implements the *Settings* menu.

### Platform-Specific Behavior

* **Button-based devices:**
  The *Settings* menu is accessed as a parallel menu to the homepage. It is triggered by scrolling over the title or footer of the *Homepage* menu, mimicking how the system settings menu is accessed on devices like the Fenix 7 Pro or Epix 2 Pro.

* **Touch-based devices:**
  Due to less effective gesture support, the *Settings* menu appears as a regular menu item within the *Homepage*.

Device-specific behavior is defined in the `monkey.jungle` build file ([link](https://github.com/TheNinth7/ohg?tab=readme-ov-file#root-folder-)). Exclusion annotations (also found in the input delegates) ensure the correct implementation per device.

### Subfolders

#### `settings-menu/menu`

Contains the `SettingsMenu` implementation based on `BaseMenu` (see [Commons](#folder-commons)), along with the corresponding input delegates for handling user interaction.

#### `settings-menu/menu-items`

Includes individual menu items used within the *Settings* menu.

---

## Folder `sitemap-menu`

Implements the main UI for displaying sitemap content.

### Subfolder `sitemap-menu/menu`

* `BasePageMenu`: Extends `BaseMenu` and provides the logic to display a list of sitemap elements at a specific hierarchy level.
* `HomepageMenu`: Represents the root level (*Homepage*) of the sitemap.
* `PageMenu`: Represents sitemap frames (folders).

Each of these has an associated input delegate. Exclusion annotations in `HomepageMenu` and `HomepageMenuDelegate` enable the platform-specific *Settings* menu behavior described [above](#folder-settings-menu).

### Subfolder `sitemap-menu/menu-items`

Contains the actual implementations of sitemap menu items (analogous to openHAB widgets).

The `factory/MenuItemFactory` class determines which menu item to instantiate based on the given `SitemapElement`.

#### Structure

* `MenuItem` classes (e.g., `OnOffSwitchMenuItem`) implement the interactive list entries.
* `Drawable` classes render visual components (e.g., `OnOffStatusDrawable` for toggle switches).
* `View` classes define full-screen views opened when selecting a menu item.

The base class `base/BaseSitemapMenuItem` provides a standard structure for all menu items, supporting:

* A left-side `Drawable` icon
* A central text label
* A right-side status indicator, also implemented via `Drawable`

#### Widget Subfolders

* `nostate`: Shown if a sitemap element has no valid state.
* `page`: Menu items representing sitemap `Frame` elements.
* `settings`: The *Settings* entry shown on touch-based devices.
* `switch`: Items representing `Switch` sitemap elements.
* `text`: Items representing `Text` sitemap elements.

## Folder `view-handling`

This directory includes:

* `ViewHandler`: A centralized utility that **must** be used for switching between views instead of calling `WatchUi` functions directly.
