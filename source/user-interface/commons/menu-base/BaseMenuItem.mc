/*
 * `BaseMenuItem` serves as the base class for all menu item implementations.
 *
 * Its current responsibility is to draw the focus indicator on devices that require it 
 * (e.g., Edge 540/840). Additional shared functionality may be added in the future.
 *
 * Subclasses must implement the `onLayout()` and `onUpdate()` methods, which mimic 
 * the behavior of the Garmin SDK`s View class. 
 * - `onLayout()` is called once before the first update to perform layout calculations.
 * - `onUpdate()` is called each time the menu item needs to be redrawn.
