/*
    Base class for command requests
    Command requests are used to issue commands to openHAB items
    There are two derivates of this class, one for the custom Webhook,
    and one for the native REST APIs
    This class 
    - holds the menu item that this request is associated with
      - the menu item has to implement the CommandRequestDelegate,
        which prescribes event handlers for processing the result of the command
    - holds the URL for the request
    - provides a function for making the request, to be used by derivates
    - processes the response and calls the event handler of the item
*/
